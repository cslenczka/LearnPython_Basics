# Create a dictionary called contact that contains these key-value pairs:
contact = {
    "fullname": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": "321-321-4321",
    "email": "test@test.com"
}
# print the contact dictionary to the console using a for loop:
for key, value in contact.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
