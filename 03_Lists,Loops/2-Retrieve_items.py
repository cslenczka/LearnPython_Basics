"""
The only way of accessing a particular element in an list(in python), is using an index.
An index is an integer number that represents the position you want to access in the list.
You need to wrap the index into brackets like this:

my_value = list[index]

"""
my_list = [4,5,734,43,45,100,4,56,23,67,23,58,45,3,100,4,56,23]
#Print on the console the 1st element of the list
print(my_list[0])
#Print on the console the 4th element of the list
print(my_list[3])
