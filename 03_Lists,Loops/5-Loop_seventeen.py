"""
To loop a specific number of times, we can use range(<start>,<end>)
In Python, range(x,y) returns a sequence of numbers starting with X, incrementing by 1 each time until it reaches the range.
Note that the number specified in range(), 5 in this example, is never reached and 4 is our last output.
